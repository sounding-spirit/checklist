## Description
This dataset is a checklist of sacred vernacular songbooks from the southern United States and its diasporas published between 1850 and 1925. The checklist features works primarily housed at the Pitts Theology Library at Emory University, the John Jacob Niles Center for American Music at the University of Kentucky, the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary Archives and Special Collections, and the Center for Popular Music at Middle Tennessee State University. The checklist assembles basic bibliographic data otherwise dispersed across the catalogs of numerous repositories. The dataset also includes data points that standard catalog records do not encompass. For instance, whenever discernable, information about denominational orientation, known distributors, and notation style is clearly indicated. (2020-04-30)
